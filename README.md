# The App

###### Using the app locally

To run the app locally, make sure to run the command bellow after running npm install:
```
npm run dev
```

This app simulates a shopping website. ReactJs is used as the front-end framework, and NodeJs
as the back-end framework. Hope you will like it!


###### Some extra work:
* Users can add/delete/edit their products
* Users are able to add item to cart and checkout
* The edit and checkout part was done using react popup
* Checkout form with promo code. The promocode to get
$3.99 dollars off is 'DISCOUNT'
* Checkout with card information. Add the correct card information to be able to chekout.
The information is: 

| Info          | Value             |  
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| card number:  | 4242424242424242  |
| expiry month: | 12                |
| expiry year:  | 16                |
